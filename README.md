WordPress Child Theme

## Goals
This child theme is used to create websites that are tailored to the client. The initial stylings will serve as a wire frame for content while the site is being developed.

## Recent Updates

- 4/13 Presented initial repo to team.
- 4/17 Added more sass files.
- 4/20 Created a new cover image for Maverick.


## Getting Started

- There are custom enqueue options built into the theme Customizer under HMS Options.
- Certain files will not be included in the git repo so that unique customization can take place. "Ex: /inc/site".
- The theme updater functionality uses a version control that compares a github repo for the most current version and then updates accordingly.
